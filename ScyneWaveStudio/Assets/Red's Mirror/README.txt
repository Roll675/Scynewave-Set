Thank's for checking out my mirror shader!

To use this you will need to make a mask for the mirror's in Photoshop (Or Gimp) And place it into the mask slot inside the shader. Set this up with the standard VRC Mirror prefab and you are good to go!

This prefab was made to help world creators who want to have "split mirrors" without the added performance cost's of two or more mirrors. 

Check out "Two Thousand Mirrors" to see this in action - https://vrchat.net/home/launch?worldId=wrld_41307edf-6012-41bf-af8d-7433665cf52f&instanceId=75188



If you wanna show some appreciation just follow me on soundcloud lol - https://soundcloud.com/wearelostandsound

Huge shoutout to ScruffyRules for helping recreate the base mirror inside a node setup for me to mess with, I apprecaite you homie!
